            "The heat of autumn is different from the heat of summer. One ripens apples, the other turns them to cider.",
            "Is not this a true autumn day? Just the still melancholy that I loveâ€”that makes life and nature harmonize.",
            "And all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves...",
            "Its the first day of autumn! A time of hot chocolatey mornings, and toasty marshmallow evenings, and, best of all, leaping into leaves!",

            "Autumn shows us how beautiful it is to let things go",
